  <h1>Hi, I'm Jihad</h1>
  <h3>a web developer</h3>
  <blockquote> "I am so interesting join to CYF because I believe that there I will find a world-class professional in the tech industry and I will be surrounded by people who have the same interest and passion as me, and this can be obvious from CYF graduates who work in the world- class companies.
I'd like to be a hero in this industry because my story with technology started since I was a child, I started using windows 95 at age 7 then I found myself very interesting in

technology, then I joined the university to continue this journey, at this

point the chaos occurred !! I was young and had a general Idea about technology

but there was no one at that time who directed me into the market needs, also at that

time, 2010, it was really hard to predict the future of the web development industry.

I choose B.sc in Electronics Engineering, and I thought it is the best choice for me and I can make my dreams with it.

I graduate and got the degree, I studied a lot of stuff including programming but

with no clear vision. After finishing school I was shocked by the reality!, there is a minor need
for this degree in my country, Sudan, and it will not secure me good bread and butter !!
I kept my degree aside and went to look for a better job. Circumstances
got harder in Sudan, and I decided to come to the UK. Here I remember my old love, the technology üòç‚ùó
Then searched again shocked !! but by the amount of information, advices, and roadmaps available which was not in the past. then I
said that is it, I am back!.   
At the moment I am so enthusiastic greedy to learn to code and had a job in tech industry.
